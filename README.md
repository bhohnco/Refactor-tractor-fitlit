  * Put into practice writing making network request to an API endpoint.
  * Utilize inheritance to to dry up code.
  * Leverage Sass to refactor and clean up CSS
  * Use Webpack to streamline workflow.

## Setup

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text and a pink background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## Overview

*  This is a group student project to begin to understand the nuances of working with an existing code base. We were tasked to improve an existing application. The improvements made were in the adding of a API, refactor code with Sass and JS inheritance and adding a new feature of data collection.

## Set-up
